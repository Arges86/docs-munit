= Patching the Embedded Mule Runtime Engine Version

Patching in MUnit is different than how the Mule runtime engine is patched. MUnit runs using an embedded Mule runtime engine container, which downloads all required dependencies to start a Mule runtime engine based on a given version. To use a patched Mule runtime engine version, for example `4.1.2-hf2`, you must point MUnit to run specifically against it. You can do this from either Maven or Studio.

== Patching MUnit Using Maven

By default, MUnit runs against the Mule version corresponding to the `minMuleVersion` defined in the `mule-artifact.json` file. You can override this version by using the `runtimeVersion` attribute of the `munit-maven-plugin` artifact configuration:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<plugin>
    <groupId>com.mulesoft.munit.tools</groupId>
    <artifactId>munit-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>${munit.version}</version>
    <executions>
        <execution>
            <id>test</id>
            <phase>test</phase>
            <goals>
                <goal>test</goal>
            </goals>
        </execution>
    </executions>
    <configuration>
      <runtimeVersion>4.1.2-hf2</runtimeVersion> //<1>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
----
<1> This version is a placeholder example. You must declare the correct version provided by MuleSoft.

== Patching MUnit Using Studio

By default, MUnit runs in Anypoint Studio with the Mule runtime engine version of the project’s server. You can override this version by specifying the patched Mule version in the MUnit run configuration menu:

. In the top menu bar, go to *Run* and *Run Configurations…*.
. Under *MUnit*, select your MUnit test file.
. In the *Mule Runtime Version* field under *Advanced Settings* type the MUnit patched version you want to use.

If you already set the `runtimeVersion` attribute in the POM file of your project as shown in previous Maven instructions, you can click the *Load configuration from POM file* option to automatically load this version into the *Mule Runtime Version* field.
